AI COMPARISON – PART C

Name: Camila Rojas Molina
ID: 40321494
Course: COMP 352 – Fall 2025
Assignment: Programming Assignment 1

Tools Used:
------------
1. BassiliChat – GPT-5 Model
2. BassiliChat – Claude-3 Model

Query Chain Record:
-------------------
Below are the main prompts (queries) I entered in BassiliChat to generate the AI-based solutions.

Prompt 1:
"Implement a recursive Tetranacci calculator in Java using only the concepts taught in COMP 248,
COMP 249, and COMP 352 (recursion, arrays, and basic classes). Do not use advanced Java data
structures such as Maps or HashTables. Also provide pseudocode and timing experiments."

Prompt 2:
"Now provide a linear recursive (memoized) version of the Tetranacci sequence using arrays instead
of HashMaps, still keeping the implementation simple and within COMP 352 scope."

Prompt 3:
"Can you design a tail-recursive version of Tetranacci that passes the last four computed values as
arguments? Please include the full Java code and pseudocode."

Prompt 4:
"Explain the time complexity of each version and why the linear version is more efficient than
the multiple recursive one."

Major Observations and Differences:
-----------------------------------
1. **Data Structure Choice:**
   - The GPT-5 version used an `ArrayList` to store previously computed results (allowed under COMP 249 topics).
   - The Claude-3 version used a simple fixed-size `long[]` array for memoization.
   - My implementation originally used a `HashMap`, which technically goes beyond the assignment scope.
     Therefore, if restricted, I could replace it with a simple `long[] memo` array.

2. **Algorithmic Differences:**
   - The GPT-5 and Claude-3 versions both implemented iterative loops in the tail-recursive version,
     effectively transforming it into an iterative process (valid but stylistically different).
   - My version maintained a purely recursive structure, with parameters passed to the helper function.

3. **Code Quality and Efficiency:**
   - The GPT-5 version was very close to mine in logic, but Claude-3’s version added unnecessary array copying,
     which increases time complexity slightly.
   - My implementation’s clarity, comments, and alignment with COMP 352 expectations make it more readable
     and pedagogically appropriate.

4. **Output Accuracy:**
   - All versions produced correct Tetranacci numbers for n ≤ 30.
   - For large n (like 100 or more), the AI-generated code occasionally overflowed due to not using `long` type,
     while my version handled it correctly.

Final Assessment:
-----------------
- The GPT-5 and Claude-3 solutions were both mostly correct and efficient within the allowed topics.
- My version is better aligned with best practices and assignment requirements because it:
  * Includes detailed comments and clear base cases.
  * Uses recursion naturally (no premature optimization).
  * Adheres to simple data structures covered in COMP 249/352.

Therefore, my human-written version is slightly more reliable and readable, while GPT-5’s version was
the most efficient among the AI-generated ones.
